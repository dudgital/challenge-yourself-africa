# Welcome To The #ChallengeYourselfAfrica Mission Instructions Repo

#ChallengeYourselfAfrica Project was inspired by [Alex](https://github.com/ka11away) the creator of [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/). Our aim is not to reinvent what he's done but to create structured missions on {coding, photography, marketing, SEO, etc} for interested people to complete.

## Translations
This project is not translated to any language other than English. If you want to help by providing a translation in the language you know, submit a pull request (or DM me on Twitter @dudgital), adding a sub-folder in the 'lang' folder with the files of the translation there.

## Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:

1. Check out the [Official Site](https://dudgital.com/challenge-yourself-africa) for the #ChallengeYourselfAfrica movement. 

2.  **Use the [link](https://github.com/dudgital/challenge-yourself-africa-projects) to view and clone your classified mission files.**

3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**

4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**

5.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.

6.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.

7.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #ChallengeYourselfAfrica hashtag.**

8.  Follow [Dudgital, creator of #ChallengeYourselfAfrica](https://twitter.com/dudgital) & [ChallengeYourselfAfrica](https://twitter.com/) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #ChallengeYourselfAfrica hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. 
<!-- Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it! -->

9.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple of people (or more) right away.

10.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo or just tweet at me (see info below)
