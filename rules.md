# Rules of the Challenge Yourself Africa

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
June 1st, 2021. [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #ChallengeYourselfAfrica #100DaysOfCode

2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

4. If you are a new to coding, read [FAQ](FAQ.md)


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post or social media post

2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)

3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)

4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.

5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
